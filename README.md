This code is an official demo of PyTorch implementation of SciRE-Solver.

# [Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableDiffusion) 
The code is now available in the ['sd_scire'](sd_scire/stable-diffusion/ldm/models/diffusion/scire_solver) folder, and we welcome everyone to use the scire-solver on stable-diffusion. Next, we will integrate the code into the stable-diffusion repository.

SciRE-Solver with multistep method can generate higher-quality samples in just a few steps, empirically, while also producing better quality samples than DPM-Solver++ at 50 steps. While maintaining high quality, samples generated by SciRE-Solver with both singlestep and multistep also exhibit selectable diversity. 


Here we provide two versions of the 'scire-solver', and three different types of methods.
- algorithm_type: 'scire_v1' or 'scire_v2'
- method: "multistep" or "singlestep"(agile) or "singlestep_fixed".

- When using a small number of sampling steps, we recommend using "multistep" method as:
  - "scire_v1-2m"
  - "scire_v1-3m"
  - "scire_v2-2m"
  - "scire_v2-3m" (at 6 steps, it is empirically better than other "m" options.)
- When the number of sampling steps '>= 26', we recommend trying all available options.

# Test SciRE-Solver on EDM (1.76 FID on CIFAR-10)
- SciRE_v1-2 (singlestep_fixed) with cpkt ([edm-cifar10-32x32-cond-vp.pkl](https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm/pretrained/edm-cifar10-32x32-cond-vp.pkl)) attian $2.29$ FID with $12$ NFE, $2.16$ FID with $14$ NFE, $1.94$ FID with $20$ NFE, $1.79$ FID with $50$ NFE, $1.76$ FID with $100$ NFE, when $\phi_1(m)=\phi_1(3)$.
