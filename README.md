*The <em>SciRE-Solver</em> is a class of accelerating sampling algorithms tailored for diffusion models, requiring <em>no training and optimization</em>. Its numerical algorithm design is fundamentally predicated on the score-integrand form and the following recursive difference  refinement, a novel  numerical  approach we introduce for improving the integral of the score function networks.*

**(Update 2025.6.27) Existing fast samplers like DPM-Solver rely on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) transformations, yet suffer from numerical instability near the final denoising steps due to SNR divergence (as $\sigma_t \to 0$). To address this limitation, we propose a novel reformulation based on the Noise-to-Signal Ratio (NSR), which naturally vanishes as time approaches zero, offering improved numerical conditioning.**

SciRE-Solver encompasses two algorithm types: **SciRE_v1** and **SciRE_v2**, which come with three available iteration modes: **multistep**, **singlestep_agile**, and **singlestep_fixed**. 

**SciRE-Solver, while accelerating, has achieved a better 'FID' compared to the previous achievements of pre-trained models.**



# Test SciRE-Solver on EDM (1.76 FID on CIFAR-10)
- SciRE_v1-2 (singlestep_fixed) with cpkt ([edm-cifar10-32x32-cond-vp.pkl](https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm/pretrained/edm-cifar10-32x32-cond-vp.pkl)) attian $2.29$ FID with $12$ NFE, $2.16$ FID with $14$ NFE, $1.94$ FID with $20$ NFE, $1.79$ FID with $50$ NFE, $1.76$ FID with $100$ NFE, when $\phi_1(m)=\phi_1(3)$.


# [Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableDiffusion) 
The code is now available in the ['sd_scire'](sd_scire/stable-diffusion/ldm/models/diffusion/scire_solver) folder, and we welcome everyone to use the SciRE-Solver on stable-diffusion. Next, we will integrate the code into the stable-diffusion repository.

Args:
- algorithm_type: 'SciRE_v1' or 'SciRE_v2'
- method: "multistep" or "singlestep_agile" or "singlestep_fixed".

- When using a small number of sampling steps, we recommend using "multistep" method as:
  - "SciRE_v1-2m"
  - "SciRE_v1-3m"
  - "SciRE_v2-2m"
  - "SciRE_v2-3m" (at 6 steps, it is empirically better than other "m" options.)
- When the number of sampling steps '>= 26', we recommend trying all available options that can help produce diversity (single-step with 50 NFE may better, empirically). 

Empirically, SciRE-Solver with the multistep method can generate higher-quality samples in just a few steps and outperforms DPM-Solver++(multistep) in terms of sample quality even after 50 steps. While maintaining high quality, samples generated by SciRE-Solver using  singlestep(and fixed) and multistep methods also display selectable diversity.

# TODO:

# Update (2025.6.27)
**Our approach is both simple and effective. More importantly, beyond its simplicity, it is a fundamentally original method that requires no post-optimization or re-optimization using pre-generated solutions or trajectories. 
This work was initially met with challenges during the review process, where reviewers requested comparisons with methods that depend on post-optimization or re-optimization using pre-generated trajectories. We believe our approach offers a fundamentally different and valuable contribution to the field.**

**We remain resilient. We welcome the community to try SciRE-Solver and look forward to your feedback and contributions.**
